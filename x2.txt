and that is it
Leave no trace isn't a slogan — it's a responsibility.
Carry all your trash back, even the tiniest tissue or fruit peel. Nature can't clean up after you — but future hikers will thank you.

2.
Stay on the trail.
Off-trail wandering crushes plants, disrupts animal paths, and erodes soil. The earth remembers every footprint.

3.
Use eco-friendly sunscreen and bug spray.
Chemicals in regular products harm aquatic life and plants. Protect your skin and the streams.

4.
Forget plastic. Go reusable.
Carry a refillable water bottle, lunchbox, and utensils. What you carry in shouldn’t outlive you by centuries.

5.
Don’t feed wildlife — even “just a piece.”
Feeding animals changes their behavior and diets. Wild means wild — not dependent on human snacks.

6.
Silence isn’t awkward in nature. It’s respect.
Loud music and shouting disrupt both animals and fellow hikers. Let the forest be your playlist.

7.
Tell someone your plan before you go.
Where, when, with whom. Nature is beautiful, but it’s also unpredictable. Being found is easier than being searched for.

8.
Always carry offline maps or a paper backup.
Phone signal fades fast in the wild. Digital confidence shouldn’t be your survival strategy.

9.
Dress smart, not just cute.
Wear layered, weather-appropriate clothes and sturdy shoes. Nature rewards respect — not fashion risks.

10.
Take only photos, leave only soft footprints.
Don’t collect flowers, rocks, or branches. Let nature look just as wild for the next soul who wanders in.
